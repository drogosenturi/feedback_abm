\section{Overview}
\subsection{Purpose and Pattern}

The purpose of this model is to investigate the positive feedback loop between urban residents, their
decisions about vegetation in their yards, and bird species richness. The ecological trends that
result from these interactions (i.e., increased bird populations, increased vegetation structure)
are meant to inform policy on urban infrastructure, neighborhood regulations on yard vegetation,
and education programs for homeowners. The model is parameterized based on empircal
knowledge of vegetation structure, bird populations and behavior, and human behavior
to answer the following questions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item How do residents' opinions of birds affect the decisions they make about 
    vegetation structure in their yards?
    \item How do bird populations respond to vegetation structure in yards?
    \item What spatial patterns emerge on the landscape over long periods of time?
\end{itemize}
